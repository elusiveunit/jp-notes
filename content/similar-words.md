## <ruby lang="ja"><rb>田</rb><rt>た</rt></ruby>, <ruby lang="ja"><rb>水</rb><rt>すい</rt><rb>田</rb><rt>でん</rt></ruby>, and <ruby lang="ja"><rb>田</rb><rt>た</rt>んぼ</ruby>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> - <span lang="ja">田圃</span> is usually written in <span lang="ja">田んぼ</span> or <span lang="ja">たんぼ</span>, and it's the word usually used in conversations.<br>
> - <span lang="ja">水田</span> is a Sino-Japanese word (<span lang="ja">漢語</span>), and it sounds more technical/formal. You will find <span lang="ja">水田</span> in official documents, scientific articles, and such.
> - <span lang="ja">田</span> is not a word commonly used in isolation in sentences (at least in modern standard Japanese). In most cases it appears in compound words such as <span lang="ja">水田</span>, <span lang="ja">田園</span>, <span lang="ja">田畑</span> and <span lang="ja">田植え</span>.
>
> In some dictionaries, <span lang="ja">水田</span> seems to be defined as something like "<span lang="ja">田</span> filled with water", as if dry <span lang="ja">田んぼ</span> were not <span lang="ja">水田</span>. IMHO you can ignore this definition and think <span lang="ja">水田</span> almost always just means "rice field".

## <ruby lang="ja"><rb>全</rb><rt>ぜん</rt><rb>部</rb><rt>ぶ</rt></ruby> and <ruby lang="ja"><rb>全</rb><rt>すべ</rt>て</ruby>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> According to [goo dictionary](http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/119767/m0u/), <span lang="ja">すべて</span> and <span lang="ja">全部</span> are interchangeable in a lot of situations. However, <span lang="ja">すべて</span> may be used more in articles, and <span lang="ja">全部</span> more in conversations <span lang="ja">(「すべて」は文章語的で、「みな」「全部」は口語的である。)</span>.
